This document serves as a whiteboard to research the necessary state and its shape for this project


## Elements
Images are already being filtered to > 600px tall. Of those images, I need to be able to track some things:

* The image key/name (path)
* The image path itself (Needed?)
* The related Fullscreen or Phone image (Advanced)
* Whether or not its been saved already

## Config
* Output directory
* Image states
